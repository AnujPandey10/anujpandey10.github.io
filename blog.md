  <p class="post-meta">📅 January 5, 2025 | 🏷️ Machine Learning, Bioprocessing, Best Practices</p>
  <p>
    AI in bioprocessing is most effective when combined with domain knowledge, controlled experimentation, 
    and good data practices. In my experience, models succeed when they are interpretable, grounded in process 
    understanding, and designed to support decisions, not replace them.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Key Topics:</strong> Domain knowledge integration, Model interpretability, 
    Practical deployment, Regulatory considerations

  <p class="post-meta">📅 January 1, 2025 | 🏷️ Statistics, DOE, Machine Learning</p>
  <p>
    Machine learning has become popular in bioprocess optimization, but Design of Experiments remains 
    irreplaceable in regulated and complex biological systems. From my experience in pharmaceutical 
    manufacturing, DOE provides interpretability, controlled experimentation, and regulatory confidence.

  <p>
    <strong>Key Topics:</strong> DOE fundamentals, ML vs. traditional methods, 
    Regulatory requirements, When to use which approach
