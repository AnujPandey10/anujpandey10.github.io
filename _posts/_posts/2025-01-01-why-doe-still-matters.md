title: "Why DOE Still Matters in the Age of Machine Learning"
---

Machine learning has become popular in bioprocess optimization, but **DOE remains irreplaceable** in regulated and complex biological systems.

From my experience in pharmaceutical manufacturing, DOE provides:
- Interpretability
- Controlled experimentation
- Regulatory confidence

ML works best **after** DOE establishes understanding, not before.
