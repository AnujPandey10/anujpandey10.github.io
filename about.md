## 👨‍🔬 Who I Am

I'm a **Data Scientist at Wockhardt Ltd.**, specializing in applying AI, machine learning, and computational biology to accelerate innovation in biotechnology and pharmaceutical research. My work sits at the fascinating intersection of **data science, biology, and pharmaceutical manufacturing**.

With an **MTech from IIT Kharagpur** and hands-on experience in **pharmaceutical R&D environments**, I bring a unique perspective that combines:
- Deep understanding of computational biology and bioprocess systems
- Advanced machine learning and AI techniques (including LLMs)
- Rigorous statistical methodology and Design of Experiments (DOE)
- Practical application to biosimilar development and process optimization

## 🎯 My Philosophy

> **"Good models come from good understanding of the process, not just algorithms."**

I firmly believe that the most powerful data science solutions emerge when we:

<div class="section">

1. **Start with the Science**: Understanding the underlying biology and chemistry is non-negotiable
2. **Apply Appropriate Methods**: DOE and statistical modeling before jumping to ML
3. **Ensure Interpretability**: Models must be explainable, especially in regulated environments
4. **Focus on Impact**: Technology should solve real problems, not just showcase capability
5. **Maintain Rigor**: Every solution must meet regulatory standards and quality requirements

## 💡 What I Do

<div class="skills-grid">

<div class="card">

### 📊 Process Optimization

I design and analyze experiments (DOE) to optimize manufacturing processes, focusing on:
- Improving product yield and quality
- Reducing process variability
- Understanding critical process parameters
- Developing robust operating spaces

</div>

<div class="card">

### 🤖 Predictive Modeling

I build machine learning models that provide actionable insights:
- Quality prediction and early warning systems
- Process monitoring and anomaly detection
- PK/PD outcome prediction
- Equipment failure prediction

</div>

<div class="card">

### 📚 Knowledge Management

I develop AI-powered systems for manufacturing knowledge:
- RAG-based SOP query systems
- Manufacturing knowledge bases
- Automated documentation analysis
- Decision support tools

</div>

<div class="card">

### 📈 Data Strategy

I help organizations make better use of their data:
- Data infrastructure design
- Analytics capability building
- Team training and mentoring
- Best practices implementation

</div>

</div>

## 🌟 What Makes My Approach Different

<div class="section">

### Regulatory-First Mindset

Working in pharmaceutical manufacturing means every model must be:
- **Validated** according to regulatory standards
- **Documented** with complete traceability
- **Explainable** to auditors and stakeholders
- **Robust** under diverse conditions

This isn't a constraint—it's a framework that ensures quality and reliability.

### Science-Driven Analytics

I don't believe in black-box solutions. Every model I build:
- Is grounded in process understanding
- Uses features that make scientific sense
- Provides interpretable outputs
- Can be explained to non-technical stakeholders

### Practical Focus

I care about solutions that:
- Actually work in production environments
- Can be maintained by the manufacturing team
- Provide clear ROI
- Integrate with existing systems

</div>

## 🎓 Background & Journey

My journey into data science started with a strong **engineering foundation** and evolved into applying **AI and computational biology** to solve real pharmaceutical challenges.

**Academic Foundation:**
- **MTech from IIT Kharagpur** (2022-2024) - Advanced training in data science and machine learning
- **BTech from SVP University** (2018-2022) - Engineering fundamentals with 8.24 CGPA
- Active in NSS and NCC - Leadership and social service (3 years each)

**Professional Evolution:**
- Started with **back-end development** internship at Wesoftek Solutions
- Transitioned to **Data Science at Wockhardt Ltd.** (Nov 2024 - Present)
- Leading initiatives in **AI-powered solutions** for pharmaceutical R&D
- Applying **computational biology** to biosimilar development
- Building **LLM-based systems** for knowledge management

**Continuous Learning:**
- Recently completed intensive **CBT Course Series at IIT Delhi** (2025)
- Certified in **Machine Learning In Production** (DeepLearning.AI, Apr 2025)
- **Google Data Analytics** certified (Dec 2024)
- Active learner in biopharma digital transformation
- Following latest developments in AI, ML, and computational biology

## 💭 My Perspective on AI in Pharma

<div class="section">

AI and machine learning are **transformative tools**, but they're not magic:

**Where AI Excels:**
- Pattern recognition in large datasets
- Complex non-linear relationships
- Predictive maintenance
- Knowledge retrieval and synthesis

**Where Traditional Methods Win:**
- Small, designed experiments (DOE)
- Causal inference
- Regulatory submissions (often)
- Clear, simple relationships

**The Best Approach:**
- Use both as complementary tools
- Let the problem guide the method
- Always validate and verify
- Keep humans in the loop

</div>

## 🌱 Beyond Work

When I'm not analyzing data or optimizing processes, I:
- Play **badminton** (active during college years at IIT Kharagpur)
- Stay curious about new technologies and methodologies in AI and biotech
- Read about advances in computational biology and pharmaceutical innovation
- Engage in **social service** - 3 years in NSS, 3 years as Senior Cadet in NCC
- Enjoy sharing knowledge and connecting with professionals in the field
- Follow thought leaders like Yann LeCun and industry innovators

## 🤝 Let's Connect

I'm always interested in:
- Discussing challenges in pharmaceutical data science
- Exploring collaborations on interesting problems
- Sharing knowledge and experiences
- Learning from others in the field
