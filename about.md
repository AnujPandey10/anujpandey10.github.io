  <h1>About Anuj Pandey</h1>
  <p class="tagline">Data Scientist | AI Engineer | Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Specialist</p>
</div>

## 👨‍🔬 Who I Am

<p>I'm a <strong>Data Scientist at Wockhardt Ltd.</strong>, specializing in applying AI, machine learning, and computational biology to accelerate innovation in biotechnology and pharmaceutical research. My work sits at the fascinating intersection of <strong>data science, biology, and pharmaceutical manufacturing</strong>.</p>

<p>With an <strong>MTech from IIT Kharagpur</strong> and hands-on experience in <strong>pharmaceutical R&D environments</strong>, I bring a unique perspective that combines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deep understanding of computational biology and bioprocess systems</li>
<li>Advanced machine learning and AI techniques (including LLMs)</li>
<li>Rigorous statistical methodology and Design of Experiments (DOE)</li>
<li>Practical application to biosimilar development and process optimization</li>
</ul>

## 🎯 My Philosophy

> **"Good models come from good understanding of the process, not just algorithms."**

I firmly believe that the most powerful data science solutions emerge when we:

<div class="section">

<ol>
<li><strong>Start with the Science</strong>: Understanding the underlying biology and chemistry is non-negotiable</li>
<li><strong>Apply Appropriate Methods</strong>: DOE and statistical modeling before jumping to ML</li>
<li><strong>Ensure Interpretability</strong>: Models must be explainable, especially in regulated environments</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Impact</strong>: Technology should solve real problems, not just showcase capability</li>
<li><strong>Maintain Rigor</strong>: Every solution must meet regulatory standards and quality requirements</li>
</ol>

</div>

## 💡 What I Do

<p>I specialize in bridging the gap between advanced data science and pharmaceutical manufacturing. My work encompasses process optimization through Design of Experiments (DOE), building predictive models for quality control, and developing AI-powered knowledge management systems.</p>

## 🌟 What Makes My Approach Different

<div class="section">

<h3>Regulatory-First Mindset</h3>

<p>Working in pharmaceutical manufacturing means every model must be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Validated</strong> according to regulatory standards</li>
<li><strong>Documented</strong> with complete traceability</li>
<li><strong>Explainable</strong> to auditors and stakeholders</li>
<li><strong>Robust</strong> under diverse conditions</li>
</ul>

<p>This isn't a constraint—it's a framework that ensures quality and reliability.</p>

<h3>Science-Driven Analytics</h3>

<p>I don't believe in black-box solutions. Every model I build:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is grounded in process understanding</li>
<li>Uses features that make scientific sense</li>
<li>Provides interpretable outputs</li>
<li>Can be explained to non-technical stakeholders</li>
</ul>

<h3>Practical Focus</h3>

<p>I care about solutions that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actually work in production environments</li>
<li>Can be maintained by the manufacturing team</li>
<li>Provide clear ROI</li>
<li>Integrate with existing systems</li>
</ul>

## 💭 My Perspective on AI in Pharma

<div class="section">

<p>AI and machine learning are <strong>transformative tools</strong>, but they're not magic:</p>

<p><strong>Where AI Excels:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pattern recognition in large datasets</li>
<li>Complex non-linear relationships</li>
<li>Predictive maintenance</li>
<li>Knowledge retrieval and synthesis</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Where Traditional Methods Win:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Small, designed experiments (DOE)</li>
<li>Causal inference</li>
<li>Regulatory submissions (often)</li>
<li>Clear, simple relationships</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Best Approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use both as complementary tools</li>
<li>Let the problem guide the method</li>
<li>Always validate and verify</li>
<li>Keep humans in the loop</li>
</ul>

</div>

## 🌱 Beyond Work

<p>When I'm not analyzing data or optimizing processes, I:</p>
<ul>
<li>Play <strong>badminton</strong> (active during college years at IIT Kharagpur)</li>
<li>Stay curious about new technologies and methodologies in AI and biotech</li>
<li>Read about advances in computational biology and pharmaceutical innovation</li>
<li>Engage in <strong>social service</strong> - 3 years in NSS, 3 years as Senior Cadet in NCC</li>
<li>Enjoy sharing knowledge and connecting with professionals in the field</li>
<li>Follow thought leaders like Yann LeCun and industry innovators</li>
</ul>

## 🤝 Let's Connect

I'm always interested in:
- Discussing challenges in pharmaceutical data science
- Exploring collaborations on interesting problems
- Sharing knowledge and experiences
- Learning from others in the field
