title: "About Me"
---

I have a background in **biology and pharmaceutical sciences**, and I currently work as a **Data Scientist / AI Engineer** in the pharmaceutical industry.

Over the years, my work has evolved from understanding biological systems to applying **statistical modeling, DOE, and machine learning** to improve complex bioprocesses.

My core interests include:
- Insulin and peptide manufacturing
- Bioprocess data analysis
- Design of Experiments (DOE)
- Machine learning for industrial systems
- Explainable AI for regulated environments

I strongly believe that **good models come from good understanding of the process**, not just algorithms.
