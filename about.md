## 👨‍🔬 Who I Am

<p>I'm a <strong>Data Scientist at Wockhardt Ltd.</strong>, specializing in applying AI, machine learning, and computational biology to accelerate innovation in biotechnology and pharmaceutical research. My work sits at the fascinating intersection of <strong>data science, biology, and pharmaceutical manufacturing</strong>.</p>

<p>With an <strong>MTech from IIT Kharagpur</strong> and hands-on experience in <strong>pharmaceutical R&D environments</strong>, I bring a unique perspective that combines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deep understanding of computational biology and bioprocess systems</li>
<li>Advanced machine learning and AI techniques (including LLMs)</li>
<li>Rigorous statistical methodology and Design of Experiments (DOE)</li>
<li>Practical application to biosimilar development and process optimization</li>
</ul>

## 🎯 My Philosophy

> **"Good models come from good understanding of the process, not just algorithms."**

I firmly believe that the most powerful data science solutions emerge when we:

<div class="section">

<ol>
<li><strong>Start with the Science</strong>: Understanding the underlying biology and chemistry is non-negotiable</li>
<li><strong>Apply Appropriate Methods</strong>: DOE and statistical modeling before jumping to ML</li>
<li><strong>Ensure Interpretability</strong>: Models must be explainable, especially in regulated environments</li>
<li><strong>Focus on Impact</strong>: Technology should solve real problems, not just showcase capability</li>
<li><strong>Maintain Rigor</strong>: Every solution must meet regulatory standards and quality requirements</li>
</ol>

## 💡 What I Do

<div class="skills-grid">

<div class="card">

<h3>📊 Process Optimization</h3>

<p>I design and analyze experiments (DOE) to optimize manufacturing processes, focusing on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improving product yield and quality</li>
<li>Reducing process variability</li>
<li>Understanding critical process parameters</li>
<li>Developing robust operating spaces</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="card">

<h3>🤖 Predictive Modeling</h3>

<p>I build machine learning models that provide actionable insights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality prediction and early warning systems</li>
<li>Process monitoring and anomaly detection</li>
<li>PK/PD outcome prediction</li>
<li>Equipment failure prediction</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="card">

<h3>📚 Knowledge Management</h3>

<p>I develop AI-powered systems for manufacturing knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>RAG-based SOP query systems</li>
<li>Manufacturing knowledge bases</li>
<li>Automated documentation analysis</li>
<li>Decision support tools</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class="card">

<h3>📈 Data Strategy</h3>

<p>I help organizations make better use of their data:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data infrastructure design</li>
<li>Analytics capability building</li>
<li>Team training and mentoring</li>
<li>Best practices implementation</li>
</ul>

</div>

## 🌟 What Makes My Approach Different

<div class="section">

<h3>Regulatory-First Mindset</h3>

<p>Working in pharmaceutical manufacturing means every model must be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Validated</strong> according to regulatory standards</li>
<li><strong>Documented</strong> with complete traceability</li>
<li><strong>Explainable</strong> to auditors and stakeholders</li>
<li><strong>Robust</strong> under diverse conditions</li>
</ul>

<p>This isn't a constraint—it's a framework that ensures quality and reliability.</p>

<h3>Science-Driven Analytics</h3>

<p>I don't believe in black-box solutions. Every model I build:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is grounded in process understanding</li>
<li>Uses features that make scientific sense</li>
<li>Provides interpretable outputs</li>
<li>Can be explained to non-technical stakeholders</li>
</ul>

<h3>Practical Focus</h3>

<p>I care about solutions that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actually work in production environments</li>
<li>Can be maintained by the manufacturing team</li>
<li>Provide clear ROI</li>
<li>Integrate with existing systems</li>
</ul>

## 💭 My Perspective on AI in Pharma

<div class="section">

<p>AI and machine learning are <strong>transformative tools</strong>, but they're not magic:</p>

<p><strong>Where AI Excels:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pattern recognition in large datasets</li>
<li>Complex non-linear relationships</li>

<li>Small, designed experiments (DOE)</li>
<li>Causal inference</li>
<li>Regulatory submissions (often)</li>
<li>Clear, simple relationships</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Best Approach:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Use both as complementary tools</li>
<li>Let the problem guide the method</li>
<li>Always validate and verify</li>
<li>Keep humans in the loop</li>
</ul>
